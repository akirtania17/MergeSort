MergeSort Algorithm

Level 0:	Declare Variables
		Get User Inputs
		Make List
		Sort List w/ Merge
		Ask User to find Number
		Binary Search for this Number
		State where it was found

Level 1:	Get User Inputs
			Print “enter integers”
			While (count < 10 and userInt does not equal -999)
				UserInt = scanner.nextInt
				If the user int is not -999
					Integers[count] = userInt;
					Count++;

		Make List
			For (int i = 0; i < count; i++)
				New array[i] = old array[i]

		Merge Sort
			Make Class
			Code given

		Ask user for number
			input(“Enter integer you want to find”)

		Binary Search
			Make Class
			If (r >= l)
				Int mid = l +(r-l)/2
			
          If (array[mid] == x)
	      Return mid;

           if (array[mid] greater than x)
	      Return binarySearch(...)

       Return binarySearch(...)

	    Return -1;
